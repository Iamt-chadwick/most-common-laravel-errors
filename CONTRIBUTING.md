Hey there!!

I am super excited to know that you want to help other developers out there by contributing to the list of some of the common errors / Exceptions you encounter while developing awesome applications using Laravel.

The format to follow when submitting a pull request is as follow : 

* Add the error message

* And finally, the fix (Solution) for the error.

Feel free to suggest more than one solution for an error, for as long as its neat and works.

To keep things well arranged, use the format found [Here](https://github.com/yemiwebby/most-common-laravel-errors#common-errors--exception)
