## List of all common errors and Exceptions in Laravel

Personally, I have come across a lot of errors when developing applications with Laravel. Most of the errors reoccurs during development. So I thought of the need to create this repo.

##Common Errors / Exception
1. Class "User" not found

> Write the use Full\Namespace\To\Class; (Example use App\User;) at the top of the file (also known as import class in PHPStorm when you click on the yellow light bulb).



## Contributing 
Please feel free to fork this package and document any error encounter during development or on the live server with applications built with Laravel.
